# About my first project on Semester 2 

# Smart Fan Project

Our Smart Fan is a temperature and occupancy-based automation system designed to optimize energy efficiency in public spaces. The project addresses the common issue of fans being left on unnecessarily, either due to forgetfulness or lack of automation.

Motivation
This project was inspired by the need to reduce energy wastage in public places where fans often operate even without human presence. By automating fan operation based on temperature and occupancy, the Smart Fan provides a more sustainable and user-friendly solution.

My Contribution
1. Enclosure Design
Designed a durable and stable enclosure using SolidWorks to support the weight of the fan motor and the rotational forces of the fan.
Due to 3D printer size constraints (24 cm height limit), the enclosure was split into two parts for manufacturing.
Utilized epoxy plastic glue and screws to securely join the two printed parts.
2. Circuit Diagram Development
Contributed to designing the circuit diagram, ensuring smooth integration with sensors and the fan's control system.
Through this project, I developed skills in enclosure design, 3D printing, and basic circuit design. These experiences have strengthened my foundation in hardware development and collaboration in team projects.
